This is a repository for my CS255 projects

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**
The Driverpass project was a system design of a web application intended to help the client, DriverPass, to more efficiently help thier customers. The system provided thier customer with an online portal where they can access course materials, access practice tests, schedule/modify/cancel appointments, review notes and more. It is meant to replace every in-person activity with the exception of actual driver training, which woudl still be conducted in-person.

**What did you do particularly well?**
I think I did a really good and thorough job with the UML diagrams. My use-case diagram was much more thorough than my peers' and I thought it really captured the essence of the project.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I probably could have some better with the Business Requirements Document. I would improve it by adding more detail because I think there is a lot that I didn't capture, especially in the early modules.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
I interpreted the user's needs by putting myself into thier shoes to determine what I would have wanted to see in the system. After figuring out what I would want to be able to do, I worked it into the system in a way that made sense to me. It's important to consider the user's needs when designing because they are going to be the ones who will end up coming back to complain. They are also the ones who know what they are looking for and what would be helpful.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**
I approach designing software much in the same way we conducted this class. First I gather information on what the user's are looking for and what they expect the system to accomplish. From there, I desing the system and review with the user's, or at least the client, to confirm that I captured what they are looking for effectively. Then I go through a process of coding and revising until I have a perfect product. I think that process works well for designing a system and I will probably continue to do so.
